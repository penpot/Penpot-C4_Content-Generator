## 🔎 Idea overview

As a technologist, I want to generate a set of coherent raster images and texts that can fill in selected placeholders in a Penpot Board structure found in a Penpot serialized output so I can speed up a mockup process

<br>

## 💡 Feature analysis
### Approach #1 | Text-to-Text [[More](Approach\%231-Text-to-Text/)]

The system will help users to generate text for one or multiple placeholders depending on the element context. 

### Approach #2 | Text-to-image or Image-to-text in whole design [[More](Approach\%232-Text-to-image_or_Image-to-text_in_whole_design/)]
    
The system will help users to generate raster images to fulfill the design based on the existing text in the design. The text/image could be mutually replaced.

## 🏁 Final recommendation

[A1] **Text-to-Text** using a language model appears more feasible in the short term. On the other hand, [A2] **Text-to-image or Image-to-text in whole design** could potentially demonstrate higher effectiveness for the clients; however, the implementation process is more complex with moderate risks.
